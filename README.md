Quick run-down of what Battleship is:
-Battleship is a classic two-player strategy and guessing game where each player tries to sink the other’s fleet of ships on a hidden grid

How is it played:
-Each turn, a player calls a coordinate.
-The opponent checks their grid and announces “Hit” or “Miss.”
-Players mark results on their grids to track progress.
-When all parts of a ship are hit, the opponent announces, “You sunk my [ship name]!”
-The first to sink all enemy ships wins.

Overview, grid, and ships:
-Each player has two 10×10 grids — one to position their own ships and another to track attacks against the opponent. Players secretly place a set of ships, such as a Carrier (5 squares), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2), either horizontally or vertically. Ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally.

Main Objective:
-The goal is to be the first player to sink all of the opponent’s ships by correctly guessing their hidden locations on the grid. Players alternate turns by calling out coordinates, for example, “B7.” The opponent responds with either “Hit!” or “Miss!” A ship is sunk when all its spaces have been hit.
